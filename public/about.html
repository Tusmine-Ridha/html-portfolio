<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My journey into the world of computer science began unexpectedly during my 
  childhood. As a student in the 7th grade, I found myself captivated by class
   12 Mathematics and Computer Science books. The complexity and beauty of the 
   subjects left me in awe, and I vividly remember saying "wow" as I delved 
   into those advanced concepts. This early fascination, however, faded into the
    background as I completed my 10th grade and faced the decision of choosing 
    a stream for my higher secondary education.</p>

<p>Initially, I planned to pursue PCMB (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, 
  and Biology), but a pivotal moment changed my course. While discussing 
  my options with my family, my father handed me a brochure for PCMC (Physics, 
  Chemistry, Mathematics, and Computer Science) and asked, "PCMC, isn't it?" 
  This question transported me back to my 7th-grade excitement, reigniting my 
  passion for computers and mathematics. Embracing this path, I pursued PCMC 
  in my 11th and 12th grades, completed my Bachelor's in Computer Applications 
  (BCA) during the lockdown era, and further advanced my expertise with a 
  Master's in Computer Applications (MCA). Now, as a proud postgraduate, I am 
  deeply passionate about my field and excited to continue my journey in the 
  tech world.</p>
